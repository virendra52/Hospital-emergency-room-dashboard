Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI Project)
This project showcases a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes key performance metrics of a hospital's emergency room. The dashboard provides both a consolidated view over an extended period and a detailed monthly snapshot, helping healthcare professionals monitor, evaluate, and optimize emergency department operations.

Project Overview
The dashboard is designed to deliver critical insights into patient demographics, service efficiency, referral trends, and overall satisfaction. It enables data-driven decision-making and supports hospital administration in improving emergency room performance.

Key Features
Total Number of Patients: Displays the total patient count along with admission status breakdown (Admitted vs. Not Admitted).

Average Wait Time: Shows the average time taken to see a patient.

Patient Satisfaction Score: Captures feedback scores to monitor quality of care.

Patient Referral Analysis: Highlights the departments to which patients were referred, such as General Practice, Orthopedics, and Cardiology.

Age Group Distribution: Categorizes patients by age groups (e.g., 0–9, 10–19, etc.).

Gender Distribution: Analyzes patients by gender including unconfirmed cases.

Race Demographics: Provides insights into patient diversity by race.

Response Time: Displays the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.

Time-Based Patient Trends: Visualizes the number of patients by hour and day to identify peak periods.

Views Included
Consolidated View
Covers the time period from April 2023 to October 2024. Useful for long-term trend analysis and yearly performance monitoring.

Monthly View
Offers a deep-dive into individual months (e.g., August 2024), showing daily activity, satisfaction levels, and short-term trends.
